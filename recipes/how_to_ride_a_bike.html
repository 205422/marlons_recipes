            <p class="text">Learning to ride a bike for the very first time can be an exciting and exhilarating moment at any age. It signals the beginning of a whole new way to make everyday journeys and explore the world. Teaching a child to ride a bike is a gift that they can treasure for a lifetime. But how do you support a child to make the transition from stabilisers to two wheels? Here's our nine-step guide.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h2 class="card_title">What you'll need:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="list">A bike without stabalisers.</li>
                <li class="list">A spanner to remove and replace the pedals. If the      pedals aren't already marked left and right, make a note yourself as the left pedal threads in the opposite way to the right.</li>
                <li class="list">(Optional) a camera to capture the moment.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
            <p class="text">It’s an achievement that could help to build confidance. Teaching a child to ride a bike can also be a wonderful memory-making moment for you too.</p>

            <ol>
                <li class="list"><strong>Lower the seat and remove the pedals
                </strong></li>
                <p class="title_list_content">Lowering the seat and removing the pedals enables the child to scoot along on the bike with both feet (much like they would on a balance bike). Use this opportunity to provide instruction on using the brakes</p>
                <li class="list"><strong>Giant steps</strong></li>
                <p class="title_list_content">When the child is ready, encourage them to travel forwards for about 10 metres using giant steps.</p>
                <li class="list"><strong>Kangaroo hops</strong></li>
                <p class="title_list_content">Next, encourage the child to travel forwards for about 10 metres using hops.</p>
                <li class="list"><strong>Put one pedal back on</strong></li>
                <p class="title_list_content">Either left or right, it doesn’t matter. Make sure the child is comfortable on the bike and feels secure. An easy way of doing this is to get them to do a little ‘wiggle’ with the brakes on.</p>
                <li class="list"><strong>One pedal scoot</strong></li>
                <p class="title_list_content">With one foot on the pedal encourage the child to scoot forwards using the other foot. Make sure they are looking up. Stop after about 10 metres.</p>
                <li class="list"><strong> Both pedals on</strong></li>
                <p class="title_list_content">Put the other pedal on. Do the ‘wiggle’ (with brakes on) to show that the bike is stable and safe.</p>
                <li class="list"><strong>First go</strong></li>
                <p class="title_list_content">Hold the child, not the bike. Explain that you are going to hold their back and their shoulder/upper arm. Get the child to put their feet on the pedals and check that they are ready. Encourage them to look up, let go of their brakes and pedal. Walk forwards (still holding on to them) and slowly release your grip. Stop after three to five metres.</p>
                <li class="list"><strong>Second go</strong></li>
                <p class="title_list_content">Do the ‘wiggle’ (with brakes on). Holding the child as before, get them to put both feet on the pedals. Encourage them to look up. If all clear, count down from three and encourage the child to let go of the brakes and pedal forwards. Let go after a few steps, then step back to exaggerate the distance they have travelled. Shout ‘stop’ after 5 - 10 metres. Now count out the paces so they can see how far they have gone.</p>
                <li class="list"><strong>Third go</strong></li>
                <p class="title_list_content">This time, reduce contact with the child by gripping their clothes with one hand and holding the bike handlebars with the other. Repeat steps as before, releasing them after only a few steps and letting them ride for as long as they wish.</p>
