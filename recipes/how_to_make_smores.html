<p>It doesn’t get much more simple and classic than s’mores: three basic ingredients working together to make something much more delicious than the sum of its parts. We've taken these flavors and run with them more times than we can count; from our s'mores bake to s'mores grilled cheese, no s'mores rock has gone unturned. Sometimes, though, I crave the OG. Whether you keep it to the original 3 ingredients or experiment with fun toppings like caramel or sliced fruit, this is one simple dessert that never disappoints. Read on for how to make it perfectly, right at home or at your next summer camping adventure:</p>

<h2>How To Make S'mores</h2>
<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>>Graham Crackers:</strong> You can’t go wrong with a classic, and it doesn’t get more classic s’mores than graham crackers. If you want to go crazy, you can go for chocolate or cinnamon graham crackers, but I prefer the OG.</li>
    <li><strong>Marshmallows:</strong> If you’re an overachiever, you can make homemade marshmallows, but honestly…why would you? Grab the store-bought stuff; there’s a reason why it’s a go-to choice. Depending on how much of a marshmallow lover you are, you can go for the regular or jumbo.</li>
    <li><strong>Chocolate:</strong> Hershey’s is a classic choice for s’mores, and is what I personally turn to again and again. That being said, don’t feel like you can’t get creative! Your favorite piece of chocolate that will get melty and delicious will most likely work great here.</li>
</ul>

<h3>STEP-BY-STEP-INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
<p>While they are a campfire classic, you don’t need an open flame to make s’mores. I’ve got three options for you here: the grill, a campfire, or the air fryer. If you’re craving the dessert without an open flame, the air fryer is your best option for some seriously delicious s’mores. Here, I'm going to walk you through how to make them the classic way. First, you're going to want to break up your chocolate into your desired sized pieces, and your graham crackers into 8 pieces. Then, place your marshmallow onto your skewer (or marshmallow roasting stick if you have one). Whatever you use, make sure it is fire-resistant!</p>

<p>Then, you'll toast your marshmallow over the flame until it is toasted to your liking. My top tips? One: Don't put it too close to the flame, especially if you prefer your marshmallow more golden. Two: Rotate your marshmallow to get full toasty coverage. If you're an extra-toasty fan (like me), let it go until it achieves your desired color.</p>

<p>Once your marshmallow is toasted to your liking, put your chocolate square on top of your bottom piece of graham cracker. Top with your toasted marshmallow, then place the top graham cracker piece on top. Pressing down lightly (don't break the graham cracker!), pull the skewer away, leaving the marshmallow and your s'more complete.</p>
